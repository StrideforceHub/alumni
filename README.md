# Welcome to StrideforceHub Alumni
  
This repository is the result of a Hackathon in 2016 intended to benifit nonprofits using Salesforce to help with job placement and job skills recommendations.
 
## Purpose
We are developing an app that will allow nonprofits to better connect with their alumni to ensure success in both accessing and maintaining technology jobs. The app, AlumniSuccess 2.0, will be both a mobile app and web interface that will include job placement information, community connections, online mentorship, mock interviews, cohort support groups and resiliency tools for support in the job search effort. Volunteer mentors and coaches will provide essential support through this innovative app, allowing graduates to gain confidence in their technical skills and business communication in addition to developing better job-searching strategies.
  
  ```markdown
 **Salesforce** generously donates _10 enterprise licenses_ to nonprofits. This benefit will be realized by having a multi-tenant solution that cenralizes data storage and the use of Communities but synchronizes data with local instances at each nonprofit.
